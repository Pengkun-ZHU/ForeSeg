# ForeSeg
This repository contains source code of a foreground segmentation model based on the U-Net architecture was first described in `Ronneberger et al. 2015, U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image
Segmentation <https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597>`_.

See examples below for a demonstration of effect, trained by 360p image-mask pairs at home on RTX3060Ti. Training set is available at `here https://github.com/csjliang/PPR10K. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597>`_.
